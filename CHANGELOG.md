# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-26

First tagged release of the Sleeper NBA Lock-In assistant. Ready for supervised
live use; validation in a live season remains pending. Version 1.0 is reserved
for proven live operation.

### Included

- Daily lock/pass recommendations and inclusive half-point score thresholds.
- Schedule, scoring, availability and matchup ingestion with archived raw polls.
- Live banked-state inference, explicit overrides and saved recommendation provenance.
- Abstention on insufficient history, stale or incomplete inputs, calendar
  disagreement and unreadable lock state; actionable calls require known deadlines.
- Browser advice, optional push notifications and guarded daily jobs.
- A shadow report requiring two full consecutive clean weeks of daily inference,
  complete final polls and verifiable player readings before manual checks can stop.
- Historical replay, calibration, policy backtesting and manager analysis.
- A concise setup and season workflow in the README.

### Operating limits

- All locks are made manually in Sleeper. Start/sit recommendations are not included.
- Advice initially abstains until at least 400 player-games exist and other guards pass.
- Confirm the new league, season configuration, schedule and scoring at rollover.
- Cross-check inferred banked state daily until the live shadow gate passes.
- Recheck cold-start calibration around week 5. Historical and synthetic validation
  does not establish future competitive performance.

### Validation

- 723 tests passed, 1 skipped, including cron and HTTP tests with local socket access.
- Ruff lint, formatting and whitespace checks passed.
- Both final review reproductions were rerun and confirmed fixed.

The `v0.1.0` tag fixes this release's contents. Subsequent changes require a new
version; see [the release procedure](docs/releases.md).
